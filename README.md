# CustomerNotificationSelector
Author - Keenan Dehnke
This program picks a notification type based on API weather data

I loved coding this project! There were some interesting bits like parsing out the dates correctly and testing 
non-cold weather cause it's always a winter wasteland here. But overall I really enjoyed playing with this API.

I really love Revel, it's honestly my dream job, so I look forward to any next steps.
